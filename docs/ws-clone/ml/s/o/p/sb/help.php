<p id="title_p">Help with problems</p>
<p id="text_p"><strong>1. My projects are gone/corrupted after restoring</strong><br><br>ㅤㅤThis is mostly caused by exiting the app when recovering process.<br>ㅤㅤPlease never quit the app when recovery.<br>ㅤㅤHowever, its not lost! Try recoveringthe backup again. <br>ㅤㅤIf you selected "detele after backup", the system will try to recognize if there was problem<br>ㅤㅤ when recovery and not delete the backup automatically. So dont panic.<br><br>ㅤㅤIf this didnt work, this is 100% corrupted backup problem.<br>ㅤㅤNever manually add backup, they can be corrupted and lost your data!!!<br>ㅤㅤUse ONLY backups created by our app to prevent problems.<br><br>
<strong>2. I cant restore backup : error code "noADTData"</strong>
<br><br>ㅤㅤThis happens when aditional data entered by app while backup creating is gone.<br>ㅤㅤThis will also mark the backup as "fake/dangerous".<br>ㅤㅤThis dosent the backup is wrong, it still can be reovered.<br><br>
<strong>3. It says "This is not backup or is corrupted</strong>
<br><br>
ㅤㅤThis means that the system marked the backup as "fake/dangerous" to protect you.<br>ㅤㅤThat means that the aditional data was not found and the backup files dosent look fine<br>ㅤㅤWe <strong>DO NOT</strong> recomend to restore this backup!<br>ㅤㅤIt can corrupt the Sketchware data! Please be really carefull when restoring these.
