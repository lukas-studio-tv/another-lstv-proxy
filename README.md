# another-lstv-proxy
Since my DNS just won't work and with that of course my webserver, services, and apps, i am making ANOTHER proxy that should direct to my WS. I made lstv.gq (No-CloudFlare verzion of lstv.ml) but it after like a day started blocking with "NXDOMAIN". So here is an github verzion. Maybye not all APIs will work but at least the most important stuff. YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE YOUR API URL's AND ENDPOINTS. Also i'm unsure about user content, but all that is backed up on my drive and FTP so just ask me and i'll send you your copy.
